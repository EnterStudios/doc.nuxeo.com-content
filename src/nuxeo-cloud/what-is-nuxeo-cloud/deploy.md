## Concept

=> **Monitored & Controlled**: The Nuxeo Cloud Operations (NCO) team deploys ALL changes and updates to pre-prod and prod environments

=> **Fast**: Requests typically completed within 1-2 days

=> **Follow Nuxeo Best Practices**: Deployments done via Marketplace Packages so that our automation process is easily used across all projects
  - NO Snapshots of Date-Based Releases: only production ready code
  - DO NOT deploy the same Marketplace Package to the same environment multiple times

=> **Use Maintenance Windows / Minimize Impact**: Deployments done during standard maintenance windows unless otherwise specified to minimize potential impact to users

## Constraints

On Preproduction and production environments, it is not allowed to:

- Deploy Snapshot versions
- Perform Hot-Reload

## Deploy My Configuration

The Nuxeo Cloud Operations (NCO) team will deploy all changes and updates to the pre-prod and prod environments.

The cloud team typically complete deployment requests within 1 day of the ticket being submitted.

In order to support the deployment we need a JIRA SUPNXP ticket, with a ticket type of **Nuxeo Cloud Deployment** that provides the following information:
- Name and Link to the Marketplace Package (MP) with the correct version
- 3rd Party Services or SSO services required (e.g. FFMPEG, ImageMagick, Okta, etc.)
- Nuxeo Conf Updates corresponding to packages or 3rd party services
- Identify the requested Date and Time (include time zone) of deployment.
  - The cloud team will NOT perform a deployment until a date/time has been provided.
  - These can be done outside of maintenance windows.
