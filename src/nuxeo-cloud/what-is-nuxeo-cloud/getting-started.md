##  Dev Sandbox



## Environments





## Customization

Customers will have Studio access to configure their business logic and data model and to define the list of packages (including custom) that are required
The Private Marketplace will be available to customers for custom Java development
The NCO team will validate and deploy all packages to hosted production and pre-prod environments via marketplace packages
If necessary, additional Nuxeo teams (e.g. professional services) can provide support for the creation and deployment of any required configuration or customization
