## Support

Nuxeo is available to help support issues that come up after the environments have been provisioned and start being used. Typical issues include:
- Support for Application or Performance Issues
- Accidental Deletion of Data
- Data Restoration from Prod to Pre-Prod
- Deploy additional marketplace packages, 3rd party services, or configuration updates

The Nuxeo support team will provide first level support to evaluate all issues and route to the appropriate teams, including NCO.

Nuxeo is is available 24x7 to support site availability issues. If other issues are found, the team will address them following our standard customer support SLAâ€™s depending on subscription level.

**Jira** is the primary method to notify us of any issues:
- Hours of Support: only during normal business hours (9AM - 5PM EST)
- Additional support may be provided if resources are available and we are notified of critical project timelines/milestones

In the event issues are encountered that cannot be resolved, we can provide support to roll back the environment to the initial settings.

### Opening a support ticket on Cloud Environments

When [filling a JIRA Ticket]({{page version='' space='studio' page='how-to-fill-a-jira-ticket'}}), there are some aspects you show :
- Nuxeo logs and config are not required for investigations with Nuxeo Cloud environments, however screenshots and code may be.
- You don't need to specify the packages and server version deployed on your instance

## Maintenance

### Maintenance Windows

Our standard maintenance window is 7 days a week:
- EU customers: 12AM - 2AM CET

## Hotfixes, Patches, 3rd Party Updates and LTS releases

The Cloud team will proactively deploy and manage the following monthly, during the first week of each month.

- 3rd party service updates
- Infrastructure updates

The LTS upgrade process will be coordinated with customers and the appropriate development team/professional services to identify risks and minimize impact
