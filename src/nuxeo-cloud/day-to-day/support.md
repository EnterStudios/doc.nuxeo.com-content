## Support

Nuxeo is available to help support issues that come up after the environments have been provisioned and start being used. Typical issues include:
- Support for application or performance issues
- Accidental deletion of Data
- Data restoration from Prod to Pre-Prod
- Deploy additional marketplace packages, 3rd party services, or configuration updates

The Nuxeo support team provides first level support to evaluate all issues and route to the appropriate teams, including NCO.

Nuxeo is available 24x7 to support site availability issues. If other issues are found, the team will address them following our standard customer support SLAâ€™s depending on subscription level.

**Jira** is the primary method to notify us of any issues:
- Hours of Support: only during normal business hours (9AM - 5PM EST)
- Additional support may be provided if resources are available and we are notified of critical project timelines/milestones

In the event issues are encountered that cannot be resolved, we can provide support to roll back the environment to the initial settings.

### Opening a support ticket on Cloud Environments

When [filling a JIRA Ticket]({{page version='' space='studio' page='how-to-fill-a-jira-ticket'}}), there are some important aspects:
- Nuxeo logs and config are not required for investigations with Nuxeo Cloud environments, however screenshots and code may be.
- You don't need to specify the packages and server version deployed on your instance

## Maintenance

### Maintenance Windows

Our standard maintenance window is 7 days a week:
- EU customers: 12AM - 2AM CET
- US customers: 12AM - 2AM EST

Exceptions can be made to accommodate peak user times.

## Hotfixes, Patches, 3rd Party Updates and LTS releases

The Cloud team will proactively deploy and manage the following monthly, during the first week of each month.
- Nuxeo Hotfixes
- Server Patches
- 3rd party service updates
- Infrastructure updates

The LTS upgrade process will be coordinated with customers and the appropriate development team/professional services to identify risks and minimize impact
- LTS releases are supported up to 3 years after the release has been made public.
- A non-compliance fee may be imposed for customers who do not upgrade to the new LTS after an LTS release is no longer supported.

## Production and Pre-Production Maintenance

All Nuxeo Cloud Production and Pre-Production environments are supported via standard maintenance windows. These windows are available to the Nuxeo Cloud team 7 days a week in order to make any necessary updates to environments. They are typically used only 1-2 times per month.

# US and EU Standard Maintenance Windows

US customers - 12AM - 2AM EST
EU customers - 12AM - 2AM CET
Note: If required, Nuxeo Cloud can accommodate exceptions to the standard maintenance windows

# Nuxeo HotFixes

Nuxeo Cloud applies Nuxeo LTS HotFixes to all cloud environments the first full week of each month during the maintenance windows. Customer contacts are emailed 1 week before the HotFix deployment takes place. Our standard deployment is:

Pre-Prod = First Tuesday of the Month
Prod = First Thursday of the Month

# Additional Updates / Security Patches

The standard maintenance window may also be used to apply updates to 3rd party services, infrastructure or security patches. We notify customer contacts via email before these take place.
