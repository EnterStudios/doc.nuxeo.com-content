Nuxeo Cloud customers start their on-boarding with the 3 following steps:

1. The Nuxeo Cloud team gathers the information required to deploy the environments. This includes answering the following questions:
    - Where is the user base located?
    - What additional services have been purchased? (maybe links to Drive, Adobe CC, Arender, etc.)
    - Who will require access to the environments?
    - Has a development sandbox been purchased?
    - Is Nuxeo Professional Services engaged as part of the project?

2. Once all of the necessary information has been identified, the Nuxeo Cloud team deploys the necessary environments and provides the appropriate resources with access.

3. The project teams begin using the environments to start the project, configuration and testing efforts to move toward production. The environment provisioning process can take as little as one week!
