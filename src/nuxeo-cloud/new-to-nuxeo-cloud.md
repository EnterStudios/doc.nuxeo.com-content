Nuxeo Cloud customers begin by following the 3 steps identified below. 

Step 1 - The Nuxeo Cloud team gathers the information required to deploy the environments. This includes answering the following questions:
Where is the user base located?
What additional services have been purchased? (maybe links to Drive, Adobe CC, Arender, etc.)
Who will require access to the environments?
Has a development sandbox been purchased?
Is Nuxeo Professional Services engaged as part of the project?

Step 2 - Once all of the necessary information has been identified, the Nuxeo Cloud team deploys the necessary environments and provides the appropriate resources with access.

Step 3 - The project teams begin using the environments to start the project, configuration and testing efforts to move toward production. The environment provisioning process can take as little as one week!

## Production & Pre-Production Maintenance

All Nuxeo Cloud Production and Pre-Production environments are supported via standard maintenance windows. These windows are available to the Nuxeo Cloud team 7 days a week in order to make any necessary updates to environments. They are typically used only 1-2 times per month.

# US & EU Standard Maintenance Windows

US customers - 12AM - 2AM EST
EU customers - 12AM - 2AM CET
Note: If required, Nuxeo Cloud can accommodate exceptions to the standard maintenance windows

# Nuxeo HotFixes

Nuxeo Cloud applies Nuxeo LTS HotFixes to all cloud environments the first full week of each month during the maintenance windows. Customer contacts are emailed 1 week before the HotFix deployment takes place. Our standard deployment is:

Pre-Prod = First Tuesday of the Month
Prod = First Thursday of the Month

# Additional Updates / Security Patches

The standard maintenance window may also be used to apply updates to 3rd party services, infrastructure or security patches. We notify customer contacts via email before these take place.
